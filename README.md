# SQL Tickets Copilot Connector

[![build](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/actions/workflows/build.yml)
[![licence: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/licence-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

A Visual Studio solution containing working paths from SQL Server to Microsoft
365 Copilot grounding data, hardened for deployment into a regulated
environment: one behind the Graph connector agent, and two that push straight to
Microsoft Graph — a flat table, and a three level hierarchy.

Generated against the contracts extracted from `GraphConnectorsTemplate.vsix`
(`ms-graph-connectors.graphConnectors`, v3.4). The five `.proto` files under
`src/SqlTicketsConnector/Contracts/` are Microsoft's originals, copied byte for
byte and unmodified.

![How a source reaches the Microsoft 365 index: six on-premises sources — two SQL Server views, a Cloudera CDP cluster holding HDFS, Hive and Atlas, plus Oracle, Teradata and MongoDB — each read by its own console tool. Before any read a guard refuses a source that enforces access per user, and SQL Server alone has no such guard. All six tools run the shared PushCore engine against a crawl state database holding the item inventory, the run lock and the principal cache, and push straight to the Copilot connectors API. Every item is granted one AD group per connector. Microsoft Search and Microsoft 365 Copilot read the index, while a read-only dashboard, a health watchdog, reconciliation and an optional OTLP collector watch the runs](docs/architecture.png)

| Project | Model | Runs where |
|---|---|---|
| `SqlTicketsConnector` | gRPC server behind the Graph connector agent. **Never calls Microsoft Graph.** | On-premises Windows Server with the agent installed |
| `Connector.Security` | Shared secrets, certificates, credentials, SQL connections, log redaction | Class library, referenced by everything |
| `PushCore` | The push engine: connection, schema, truncation, ACLs, throttling, watermark rules, exit codes. **Names no source technology.** | Class library, referenced by every push tool |
| `PushCore.Sql` | The SQL Server half of the engine: `ISqlPushConnector`, a query and a row mapping become a source | Class library, referenced only by the SQL push tools |
| `SqlGraphPush` | Direct `PUT /external/connections/{id}/items/{itemId}` — one flat table | Operator workstation or jump box with outbound HTTPS to Graph |
| `SqlHierarchyPush` | The same, for a three level hierarchy: Customer → Engagement → TimeEntry | Same |
| `PushCore.Db` | The same for **any other ADO.NET provider**: `IDbPushConnector`. References no database driver at all — the connector supplies its own `DbProviderFactory`, so a driver's advisories reach only the executable that opens that kind of connection | Class library, referenced by the warehouse push tools |
| `OracleGraphPush` | An Oracle view, pushed direct. Reads incrementally from `LAST_MODIFIED`, and **refuses** a view carrying VPD, Label Security or Data Redaction | Host with outbound HTTPS to Graph and reach to the database |
| `TeradataGraphPush` | The same for Teradata. **Refuses** a table carrying a row- or column-level security constraint, and fails closed when `DBC` cannot be read | Same |
| `MongoGraphPush` | A MongoDB collection or GridFS bucket, pushed direct. Not relational, so it implements `IPushSource` itself. **Refuses** a view as a class and an encrypted field outright | Same |
| `CdpGraphPush` | The same, for Cloudera CDP 7.1.9. **Three connectors in one executable**, each with its own connection and configuration file: HDFS documents (`cdphdfsdocs`), Hive tables (`cdphivecontracts`) and the Apache Atlas catalogue (`cdpatlascatalog`), with per-item ACLs and Ranger routing | Windows host with Kerberos to the cluster and outbound HTTPS to Graph |
| `CdpConnector.Source` | HttpFS/WebHDFS, Hive over ODBC, the Atlas catalogue over SPNEGO, Ranger policies, ACL mapping, watermarks | Class library, referenced by `CdpGraphPush` |
| `Connector.Extraction` | File bytes to indexable text: text formats and Open XML with the BCL, PDF behind a build flag. Not CDP-specific, which is why it is not called `CdpConnector.Extraction` any more | Class library, referenced by `CdpGraphPush` and `MongoGraphPush` |

Connector ID: `9e5e2b95-e7ab-4266-98c7-4f7868d377bf`
Default port: `30303`

**Before reviewing or deploying this, read [`docs/SECURITY.md`](docs/SECURITY.md)
(control mapping), [`docs/RUNBOOK.md`](docs/RUNBOOK.md) (rotation and failure
modes) and [`docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md`](docs/ASSUMPTIONS.md).**

**Adding another SQL source** is one class and one configuration file, with no
change to the engine and no effect on the connectors already there:
[`docs/ADDING-A-PUSH-CONNECTOR.md`](docs/ADDING-A-PUSH-CONNECTOR.md).

**Before building a connector for a source this repository has not met**, read
[`docs/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md`](docs/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md). It states the reasoning
behind every routing and refusal decision here without reference to a customer or
a source technology: what a Microsoft 365 permission can and cannot represent,
why per-user enforcement cannot be indexed on any platform and what each platform
calls it, and the direction-of-error rule that decides whether an unevaluated
construct stops a run or is merely logged. It is the part meant to outlive the
engagement that produced it.

**Before building a connector at all**, check that it is the right shape of
answer: [`docs/COPILOT-ROUTING.md`](docs/COPILOT-ROUTING.md) covers connector
versus live tool call versus MCP versus a Foundry application, what each costs
to build and to run, and why data you own and data you licence from a vendor
take opposite routes. It ships with a self-contained page holding the matrices
and an eleven question router.

**Deploying the three level connector** (Customer → Engagement → TimeEntry) is a
separate procedure with its own document:
[`docs/HIERARCHY-DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/HIERARCHY-DEPLOYMENT.md), covering .NET 10
and .NET 9.

**When something is wrong and you do not yet know what**, work through
[`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md): one stage at a time from
the SQL row to the answer in Copilot, with a read-only script for each. The
direct push path fails differently and has its own —
[`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING-DIRECT-PUSH.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING-DIRECT-PUSH.md).

## Download

Two lines, same code, different target framework. Take the one your toolchain
can open — Visual Studio 2022 cannot load a `net10.0` project whatever SDK is
installed.

| Release | Framework | For |
|---|---|---|
| [**Latest release**](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/releases/latest) | `net10.0` | Visual Studio 2026, or the .NET 10 SDK |
| [**Latest `-net9` release**](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/releases?q=net9&expanded=true) | `net9.0` | Visual Studio 2022 17.12 or later, or the .NET 9 SDK |

Both lines are released together and carry the same version number. These links
follow the current one rather than naming a version, so they cannot rot: the
first resolves to whichever release is marked latest, the second lists the
`-net9` line newest first.

Each carries the same four assets:

| Asset | Size | When you need it |
|---|---|---|
| `SqlTicketsConnector-<tag>.zip` | ~90 MB | Always. Self-contained build plus a buildable source tree — the only file a deployment needs |
| `offline-packages-<tag>.zip` | ~220 MB | Only to rebuild on a machine with no route to `api.nuget.org` |
| `…zip.sha256` | | Verify before deploying; a document library round trip is exactly the sort of hop that truncates a file quietly |

Nothing else is required on the target server: the .NET runtime is inside the
package. See [Transfer via SharePoint](#transfer-via-sharepoint) for the
download, unblock and checksum sequence.

## Prerequisites

**Build machine**
- The .NET 10 SDK, alone or through Visual Studio 2026
- **Visual Studio 2022 cannot open this configuration.** It has no .NET 10
  support, so a `net10.0` project will not load there whatever SDK is installed.
  Use the .NET 9 line instead: the
  [latest `-net9` release](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/releases?q=net9&expanded=true)
  to deploy, the [`release/net9`](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/tree/release/net9)
  branch to build — see [Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 9](#visual-studio-2022-and-net-9)
- NuGet access to `api.nuget.org`, or a package folder staged from a connected
  machine — see [Building without NuGet access](#building-without-nuget-access)

**Target server** — if you deploy the release zip, this is the whole list
- Windows Server 2019 or later
- Microsoft Graph connector agent from https://aka.ms/gca, already registered
  against the tenant — see [`docs/APP-REGISTRATION.md`](docs/APP-REGISTRATION.md)
  for the app registrations, permissions and network allow-list it needs
- The connector's client certificate in `LocalMachine\My`, with its private key readable by the service account
- Network path to SQL Server

**No .NET runtime is required.** The release package is self-contained: the
runtime ships inside it. The agent and the certificate are the only two things
that cannot be in the zip — the agent is Microsoft's installer, tied to your
tenant, and the certificate has to come from your own PKI.
You do not need the VSIX installed to build this solution.

## Build

```powershell
dotnet build .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln -c Release
dotnet test  .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln
```

`Grpc.Tools` runs `protoc` during the first build and generates the C# types from
the `.proto` files. Those generated files land in `obj\` and are not checked in,
so a clean clone always needs a restore before the code will resolve in the
editor.

Expected warnings, and only these: `NETSDK1206` (Grpc.Core ships RID-specific
native assets) and `CS8981` (protoc emits all-lowercase identifiers). Both are
suppressed in the project file with a comment explaining why.

To produce the transfer package:

```powershell
.\Build.ps1
.\Build.ps1 -SelfContained          # server has no .NET 10 runtime
.\Build.ps1 -EnableOtlpExporter     # include the OTLP exporters: traces and
                                    # metrics from the push tools, log records
                                    # from the agent-hosted connector
```

`Build.ps1` runs four gates before it publishes anything — the secret hygiene
scan, a build with warnings treated as errors, the tests, and the dependency
audit — and refuses to package certificate or key material. They are the same
four the CI workflow runs. Output:
`SqlTicketsConnector-deploy-<timestamp>.zip` in the solution root.

CI produces the same package on every push to `main`, downloadable from the
workflow run, and it builds `-SelfContained` so the zip carries its own runtime.
A step then extracts the package and fails the build if the service executable,
the bundled runtime, the install script, the SQL scripts or the docs are
missing — "everything is in the zip" is checked, not assumed.

Pushing a `v*` tag additionally creates a **draft** release with the zip and its
`.sha256` attached, named after the tag; publishing it stays a human decision.

### What the package contains

```
publish/            the connector service, with the .NET runtime bundled
SqlGraphPush/       the direct push tool, also self-contained
source/             a buildable copy of this repository, no bin/ or obj/
sql/                source tables and grants, the crawl state database, the incremental source view
docs/               SECURITY.md, RUNBOOK.md, ASSUMPTIONS.md
Install-Connector.ps1, Manifest.json, ConnectionInfo.json,
CustomConnectorPortMap.json, README.md
```

To rebuild from the package rather than from a clone:

```powershell
cd source
dotnet build .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln -c Release      # needs the .NET 10 SDK
```

That still restores from NuGet. If the machine cannot reach it, see
[Building without NuGet access](#building-without-nuget-access); the two scripts
that make it possible travel inside `source\build\`.

CI fails the build if any of the above is missing from the archive, and if
`bin/`, `obj/` or `.git/` leak into `source/`.

### Visual Studio 2022 and .NET 9

Visual Studio 2022 has no .NET 10 support, so this configuration will not load
there. There is a .NET 9 line for that, and three ways into it depending on what
you want.

**To deploy, download nothing else:**
the [**latest `-net9` release**](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/releases?q=net9&expanded=true)
— the same package as the mainline release of the same version, self-contained
with .NET 9.0.19 bundled, built by the .NET 9 SDK rather than merely targeted at
it. Releases on this line carry
the `-net9` suffix; the unsuffixed ones are .NET 10.

**To work in Visual Studio 2022:** clone the
[**`release/net9`**](https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors/tree/release/net9)
branch, where the solution opens and builds with no arguments:

```powershell
git clone --branch release/net9 https://github.com/JosephSaad/m365-copilot-connectors.git
```

It is this code with two files changed — `Directory.Build.props` sets the target
framework to `net9.0`, and `global.json` pins the SDK to 9.0.x so a machine with
newer SDKs installed still builds it with .NET 9. Fixes flow from `main`.

**To build a .NET 9 package from here,** without switching branches, since the
target framework lives in one place:

```powershell
dotnet build .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln -c Release -p:ConnectorTargetFramework=net9.0
.\Build.ps1 -SelfContained -TargetFramework net9.0
```

The framework then appears in the package name — `SqlTicketsConnector-deploy-net9.0-*.zip` —
because two zips that differ only in their bundled runtime are otherwise
indistinguishable on a server.

CI builds and tests `net9.0` from `main` on every push, using the .NET 9 SDK
alone — the toolchain a VS 2022 machine actually has — so `main` cannot drift
away from a branch nobody looks at between releases.

Nothing changes for the target server. The release packages are self-contained,
so the bundled runtime is whichever one the package was built against, and the
server needs neither installed.

### Building without NuGet access

A build machine on a segregated network cannot reach `api.nuget.org`, and a
restore that cannot reach it fails with `NU1301` rather than anything that names
the real problem. Stage the packages from a connected machine instead:

```powershell
.\build\Get-OfflinePackages.ps1                      # writes .\offline-packages
Compress-Archive .\offline-packages\* offline-packages.zip
```

Or skip that step: every release carries **`offline-packages-<tag>.zip`** beside
the deployment package, built by CI from this same script. Two downloads then
cover a machine that has neither NuGet nor a connected neighbour. Check with
your reviewer first if your supply chain policy requires packages to come from
`api.nuget.org` or an internal mirror rather than from a GitHub release — the
bytes are identical and each `.nupkg` carries its author's signature, but the
route is different, and that is sometimes the thing under review.

Then, on the build machine, from a clone or from the `source\` tree inside a
release package:

```powershell
Expand-Archive .\offline-packages.zip -DestinationPath C:\offline-packages
dotnet restore .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln --source C:\offline-packages
dotnet build   .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln -c Release --no-restore
dotnet test    .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln -c Release --no-build
```

88 packages, about 213 MB, in four sets:

| Set | Packages | Size | Needed for |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Base | 62 | ~112 MB | any build or test run, on either target framework |
| net9.0 supplement | 6 | 2 MB | a `net9.0` build. `-TargetFramework net10.0` leaves it out |
| Runtime packs | 4 | 93 MB | `Build.ps1 -SelfContained`. `-SkipRuntimePacks` |
| OpenTelemetry | 16 | 6 MB | `Build.ps1 -EnableOtlpExporter`. `-SkipOtlp` |

**One folder covers both target frameworks.** The default downloads the union,
because six spare `.nupkg` files on an air-gapped machine cost nothing and six
missing ones cost a failed restore months later with no clue why. The six are
what `net10.0`'s shared framework provides and `net9.0`'s does not —
`System.Text.Json`, `System.Memory` and four neighbours. `net10.0`'s graph is a
strict subset of `net9.0`'s, so the union is complete for both.

The variable is the **target framework, not the SDK**. Restoring at `net9.0`
produces byte-identical graphs under the .NET 9 and .NET 10 SDKs; all six
combinations of framework, SDK and OTLP flag are checked.

The OpenTelemetry set covers two exporters that share one flag: the Serilog sink
that sends **log records** from the agent-hosted connector, and the OpenTelemetry
SDK that sends **traces and metrics** from every push tool. The gRPC packages in
it belong to the Serilog sink alone — OpenTelemetry 1.18.0 speaks both OTLP
protocols over `HttpClient` and adds no gRPC stack of its own. See
[TELEMETRY.md](docs/TELEMETRY.md).

The check reads which framework was restored out of `project.assets.json` rather
than taking it as an argument, so it compares against the right set and
`-Update` rewrites the right block. A parameter that disagreed with the restore
would delete the six entries the other target depends on, silently, and leave
the check passing.

The runtime packs are the bundled .NET runtime. Two of the four are requested
only from some build hosts — a Windows SDK asks for the WindowsDesktop pack and
already has its own apphost, a cross-build from macOS or Linux is the reverse —
so the list is the union and the CI check treats those two as optional. Their
version is chosen by the SDK rather than by this repository, so the script asks
MSBuild for `BundledNETCoreAppPackageVersion` instead of hard-coding one. It must match the
SDK on the machine that will do the offline build — pass `-RuntimeVersion` if
you are staging for a machine whose SDK differs from yours.

A checked-in package list goes stale the moment a dependency moves, so CI
compares it against the resolved graph in all three configurations and fails the
build on any drift. That check found a missing entry the first time it ran.

Every dependency bump is drift, so it fails on those too, by design and after
the build and tests have had their say. Regenerate the list in the same change:

```powershell
dotnet restore .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln
.\build\Test-OfflinePackageList.ps1 -Configuration Base -Update
```

All three restores above were verified against a staged folder with an empty
package cache, so nothing was quietly served from `~/.nuget/packages`:

```powershell
dotnet restore .\SqlTicketsConnector.sln --source C:\offline-packages --packages C:\nuget-scratch
```

#### Stopping it reaching for nuget.org at all

A source given on the command line applies to that one command. Every other
restore — Visual Studio's, an IDE background restore, a colleague running
`dotnet build` out of habit — still inherits the sources in
`%APPDATA%\NuGet\NuGet.Config` and the machine-wide configuration, `nuget.org`
among them, and fails with `NU1301` on a network that blocks it. That is why the
command line can succeed and Visual Studio's Error List still fills with
`api.nuget.org` seconds later.

Fix it for the whole tree by copying the template into the solution root:

```powershell
copy build\NuGet.offline.config NuGet.config
```

Then edit the one path in it to point at your staged folder. The
`<clear />` element is what does the work: without it the file *adds* a source to
the inherited ones instead of replacing them. Afterwards the tree sees exactly
one source, which you can confirm with:

```powershell
dotnet nuget list source
```

`NuGet.config` is not committed, deliberately: a repository that clears its
package sources cannot restore from nuget.org at all, which would break every
online build including CI. It is also in `.gitignore`, so a copy made on a build
machine cannot be committed by accident.

The .NET SDK installer itself is the one thing that cannot be staged this way:
it is not a NuGet package. Download it from Microsoft and transfer it like any
other approved installer.

---

## Transfer via SharePoint

1. Upload the zip to a document library. A release package is roughly 90 MB; a
   local `Build.ps1` without `-SelfContained` is roughly 15 MB.
2. On the agent server, download it.
3. Unblock before extracting. SharePoint downloads carry the mark of the web, and
   .NET refuses to load blocked assemblies.

A release asset is named after its tag, and a local build after the time it ran
— `SqlTicketsConnector-deploy-<timestamp>.zip`. Both work the same way; the
commands below take whichever zip is in the current folder rather than naming a
version that will be wrong by the next release:

```powershell
$zip = Get-Item .\SqlTicketsConnector-*.zip
Unblock-File $zip
```

If the package came from a CI run or a release it has a `.sha256` beside it.
Verify before extracting: a document library round trip is exactly the sort of
hop that truncates a file quietly.

```powershell
$expected = (Get-Content "$($zip.Name).sha256").Split(' ')[0]
$actual = (Get-FileHash $zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
if ($actual -ne $expected) { throw "Checksum mismatch. Do not deploy this package." }

Expand-Archive $zip -DestinationPath C:\Staging\SqlTickets
```

If the tenant blocks `.ps1` in libraries, rename to `.ps1.txt` before upload and
back after download. If it blocks `.zip` outright, use a different transfer
channel; do not disable the blocked file types policy.

---

## Deploy

1. **Prepare SQL.** Run `sql/01-least-privilege.sql` (the variant matching your
   `SqlAuthMode`) and `sql/02-soft-delete.sql` against the `Ops` database.

2. **Install the certificate** into `LocalMachine\My` on the agent server, with
   its private key. If `Connector:UseTls` stays `true`, the key must be
   exportable.

3. **Edit `appsettings.json`** in the package and replace every
   `REPLACE-WITH-…` placeholder: tenant ID, client ID, certificate thumbprint and
   the Entra group object ID that may see ticket content. Startup validation
   rejects placeholders and names each one, so a half-configured deployment
   cannot start.

4. **Install**, from an elevated PowerShell session:

```powershell
cd C:\Staging\SqlTickets
.\Install-Connector.ps1 -SourcePath .\publish -ServiceAccount 'CONTOSO\svc_gca_reader$'
```

The script copies binaries, creates the Windows event log source, verifies the
certificate is present and that the service account can read its private key
(granting Read if it cannot), merges the port map while preserving existing
entries, registers the service with restart-on-failure, sets folder permissions,
and restarts `GcaHostService`.

5. **Verify:**

```powershell
Get-Service SqlTicketsConnector, GcaHostService
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 30303 -State Listen
Get-Content C:\Connectors\SqlTickets\Logs\ConnectorLog.log -Tail 20
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source SqlTicketsConnector -Newest 20
```

Startup logs the connector ID, port, TLS state, data source and environment on
one line.

## Test before publishing a connection

The agent ships a test harness that exercises validate, schema and crawl without
touching the Microsoft index.

1. Copy `Manifest.json` and `ConnectionInfo.json` from the package into
   `C:\Program Files\Graph connector agent\TestApp\Config\`.
2. Edit the copy under `TestApp\Config\` if your server or database differ. **Do
   not put credentials in it**: SQL access comes from `appsettings.json` on the
   host, and anything typed into the credential fields is logged as ignored and
   discarded.
3. Run `C:\Program Files\Graph connector agent\TestApp\GraphConnectorAgentTest.exe`.

Iterate freely here. Nothing reaches the tenant.

`Manifest.json`, `ConnectionInfo.json` and `CustomConnectorPortMap.json` are
reference copies: every value in them that is not prose is derived from
`src/SqlTicketsConnector/appsettings.json`, which is the file the connector
itself reads. So if the difference in step 2 is permanent rather than a one-off
test, do not fix it by editing the copy in this repository — change
`DataSource:Server` and `DataSource:Database` in `appsettings.json` and run:

```powershell
pwsh build/Sync-HarnessFixtures.ps1 -Update
```

That rewrites the derived values in place and leaves the explanatory prose in
`ConnectionInfo.json` untouched. Run it without `-Update` to compare instead;
CI does that on every build and fails on any copy that has drifted.

---

## Publish the connection

Microsoft 365 admin center → Settings → Search & intelligence → Data sources → **Add**.

1. Choose **Custom connector**, upload `Manifest.json`.
2. Name the connection.
3. Data source URL: `Server=sql01.contoso.local;Database=Ops`. Authentication:
   **Windows**. Select your registered agent. Validate.
4. Skip the optional configuration step.
5. Accept the schema the agent pulled from `GetDataSourceSchema`. Confirm `body`
   is selected as the content property.
6. Set full and incremental crawl schedules. Publish.

---

## What each service call does

| Call | When | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| `GetBasicConnectorInfo` | Agent startup | Returns the configured connector GUID |
| `HealthCheck` | Polled continuously | Empty response, never touches SQL, logged at `Verbose` only |
| `ValidateAuthentication` | Wizard step 1 | Opens a connection, runs `SELECT TOP 1` including `IsDeleted` |
| `ValidateCustomConfiguration` | Wizard step 2 | Returns success; behaviour comes from the host's configuration |
| `GetDataSourceSchema` | Wizard step 3 | Returns 7 properties with semantic labels and exactly one content property |
| `GetCrawlStream` | Full crawl | Streams live rows from the checkpoint, composite watermark per item |
| `GetIncrementalCrawlStream` | Incremental crawl | Streams changed rows, emits `DeletedItem` for soft-deleted ones |
| `RefreshAccessToken` | Never here | Stub; SQL auth is not OAuth |

Health check failures in sequence cause the agent to fail the connection, which
is why it deliberately does no I/O.

## Things that will bite you

- **Port map edits need a service restart.** `GcaHostService` caches the mapping
  at startup. Symptom is "connector unavailable on specified port" even though
  the process is listening.
- **Each connector needs its own port.** Two entries pointing at 30303 will not
  both work. The port is written down in four places that have to agree:
  `Connector:Port` in `appsettings.json` decides it, and
  `deploy/CustomConnectorPortMap.json`, the `-Port` default in
  `deploy/Install-Connector.ps1` and the fallback port in
  `deploy/Test-ConnectorHost.ps1` all follow it.
- **Connector ID is permanent.** Changing it after connections exist breaks every
  one of them. It is written down in six places that have to move together:
  `src/SqlTicketsConnector/appsettings.json` (`Connector:Id` — the one that
  decides), `ConnectorInfoServiceImpl.DefaultConnectorId`,
  `deploy/Manifest.json`, `deploy/ConnectionInfo.json`,
  `deploy/CustomConnectorPortMap.json` and the `-ConnectorId` default in
  `deploy/Install-Connector.ps1`. The connector does warn at startup when the
  configured ID differs from `DefaultConnectorId`, but it only warns and starts
  anyway, on an on-premises host whose log nobody is reading at the time.
- **Do not sync those copies by hand.** `build/Sync-HarnessFixtures.ps1` derives
  all of them from `appsettings.json`: run it to compare, which is what CI does
  on every build, or with `-Update` to rewrite them after a change. It reports
  every value that has drifted, not just the first.
- **Placeholders fail startup by design.** Exit code 2 with every invalid field
  listed at once, not one per restart.
- **The ACL is not optional.** No `Acl:GrantGroupObjectIds` means the service
  refuses to start. There is no "everyone" fallback.
- **4 MB item cap.** Content is truncated at `DataSource:MaxContentBytes`
  (default 3.5 MB) with a `Warning` naming the item; anything still oversize is
  skipped with `SkipItem` rather than being sent and rejected.
- **Deletes need `IsDeleted`.** Without `sql/02-soft-delete.sql` and an
  application that soft-deletes, removals only reach the index at the next
  periodic full crawl.
- **Semantic indexing.** Copilot grounds on the semantic index. The `Title` and
  `Url` semantic labels plus a property flagged `IsContent` are what make items
  retrievable by Copilot rather than only by search.
- **Item quota.** Connector items consume tenant item quota, metered separately
  from Copilot seats. Size a production crawl against the search licensing page
  first.
- **Logs contain no ticket data.** By design — see `docs/SECURITY.md` LOG-3. Use
  the item ID and query SQL if you need to see a row.
- **`Grpc.Core` 2.40.0 is past end of support.** Kept deliberately; migrating to
  `Grpc.AspNetCore` means regenerating the server stubs and rewriting the host.
  Recorded as an accepted risk in `docs/SECURITY.md` §3.

## Direct push path (`SqlGraphPush`)

A seeding and repair tool: it proves the tenant, app registration and Copilot
grounding before anyone installs an agent, and it re-seeds a connection that has
gone wrong. It is **not** a synchroniser — it crawls nothing incrementally,
runs on no schedule, and never deletes an item. Read
[`docs/TROUBLESHOOTING-DIRECT-PUSH.md`](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING-DIRECT-PUSH.md)
before relying on it for anything ongoing.

It authenticates with the same certificate credential as the connector, and
supports the same client secret alternative (`Auth:Mode`), with the value in
Windows Credential Manager rather than in configuration.

1. Register an Entra app with the `ExternalConnection.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` and
   `ExternalItem.ReadWrite.OwnedBy` application permissions, grant admin consent,
   and upload the public certificate to it. Give it a connection ID the Graph
   connector agent does not also use: `OwnedBy` means whichever app created a
   connection is the only one that can manage it.
2. Fill in `src/SqlGraphPush/appsettings.json` (same shape as the connector, plus
   a `Graph` section). `Auth:CertificateStoreLocation` is `CurrentUser` there,
   since it usually runs interactively.
3. Run it:

```powershell
cd src\SqlGraphPush
dotnet run
```

Schema registration is a server-side long-running operation; the tool polls until
the connection reports `ready`, typically 5 to 15 minutes, and gives up after
`Graph:SchemaReadyTimeoutMinutes`.

### Three level variant (`SqlHierarchyPush`)

The same path, for hierarchical data: **Customer → Engagement → TimeEntry**. It
exists to answer one question — how do you make a search for a customer return
their engagements and their time entries, when a Graph external item is flat and
Copilot traverses nothing?

The answer is to flatten deliberately, in both directions, in SQL views: every
descendant physically carries its ancestors' searchable text, and every ancestor
carries a roll-up of its descendants.

![How the Customer, Engagement and TimeEntry hierarchy is flattened by SQL views into flat external items, each carrying its ancestors' text, so one customer search matches all three levels](docs/hierarchy-flow.png)

**To deploy it, follow [`docs/HIERARCHY-DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/HIERARCHY-DEPLOYMENT.md)** —
step by step, .NET 10 and .NET 9, from the SQL scripts to a Copilot answer. It is
a separate deployment from the ticket connector: not a Windows service, not
installed by `Install-Connector.ps1`, and sharing nothing with it at run time.
For *why* it is built this way, read
[`docs/HIERARCHY-TEST-CASE.md`](docs/HIERARCHY-TEST-CASE.md) first.

It coexists with the ticket test case rather than replacing it — different
tables, a different connection ID (`consultingwork`), and its own schema. Both
can run against one tenant.

```powershell
dotnet run --project src\SqlHierarchyPush -- --dry-run   # read the source, call no API
dotnet run --project src\SqlHierarchyPush
.\deploy\Test-HierarchySearch.ps1                        # prove the cross level search
```
